# Using track by inside ng-repeat and $filter in Controller

## Objectives

- Refactor our ng-repeat to use a Controller filter
- Integrate "track by" clause to enhance DOM render change performance

## Instructions

In this repo we've got a simple list of users, and a search bar to filter them.

- Refactor the `ng-repeat` in this repo to use track by, tracking by their name
- Apply a filter on this list in the controller, filtering on the search property.
